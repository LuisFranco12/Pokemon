## Challenge
My biggest challenge working with the Pok√©API. The API has a lot of nested data structures, which made it difficult to retrieve the information I  needed. 

I overcame the API challenge by mapping through the results array on the "https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/" url and then making another fetch request for every pokemon url that I want to display and saving the returned array in a new variable.

## Unsolved Problem
One unsolved problem is implementing a way to hide pagination numbers when there are alot of pokemon being fetched from the PokeAPI. This would make the website look cleaner
